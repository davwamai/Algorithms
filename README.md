# Algorithms
A collection of my algorithms I found either interesting or elegant.  

Find Sum In Matrix - A difficult fetching and pointer exercise from the CSCE240 course at U of SC. Finds all occurances of a given sum in a two dimensional integer matrix. 

redfoosort - A satirical solution to a CSCE240 project problem. An intentionally inefficient sorting algorithm.
